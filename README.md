## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project:
This project was to make a pirate AI agent that was able to navigate a maze and find the treasure prize hidden within. The code given to me for this was everything but the actual reinforcement algorithm. I developed the algorithm through the help of pseudocode.
    
## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
Computer scientists solve problems through the use of technology and experiment with new technological ideas to check for improvements upon their solutions. I personally approach problems in this field by attempting to address the issue with known solutions, and then improve upon my base with research into similar areas. The ethical responsibilities I have to the end user and orginization are to make sure I am not implementing malicious tactics, and to use industry standards for anything I am unsure about.
